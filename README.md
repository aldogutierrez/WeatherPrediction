# WeatherPrediction
A machine learning model that predicts comfortable temperatures for a room inside a house/apartment using weather data from
four types of climates, cold and humid, cold and dry, hot and humid, and hot and dry.

The cities that fit these profiles are:
- Halifax (Cold and Humid)
- Las Vegas (Hot and Dry)
- Phoenix (Hot and Dry)

My goal is that based on the user's perception of the temparature captured by weather stations in these cities
I can create a recommendation system that has characteristics that can make the user feel comfortable.
Hopefully, the plan is that the temperatures will be derived from historical data, and complemented by user data. 

## Tools used:
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
- Jupyter Notebooks
